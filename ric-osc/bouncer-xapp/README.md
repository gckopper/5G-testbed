# Bouncer xapp
The version of the bouncer-xapp used in here is the one from [Alexandre Huff](https://github.com/alexandre-huff/bouncer-xapp/tree/srsRAN-E2) using the "srsRAN-E2" branch.
## build.sh
This is the script I use to build the docker file, tag it and also to add it to my chart museum. I run this from inside the `bouncer-xapp/Bouncer` folder.
